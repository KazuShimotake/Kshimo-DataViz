                            <p> Some challenges we had with looking up data sets is finding data that is not missing a lot of information or contains the information we are looking for in the right format. For instance, looking for cat data we wanted to know where the breeds come from, but most of the data sets were pictures or audio files. 
                                When we did find some data sets they did not have an orgin or place column, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset?rvi=1">Cat Breeds Dataset by MA7555</a>. The other issue we ran into was the topics we wanted to look into were a bit too specialized ( like the HSP) or did not really seem to fit a machine learning learning purpose. 
                                When looking up things like sleep and dailights saving , only studies on the different sleep phases showed up. When looking for cat data set we ran into a lot of data for training an image recognition model, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dseidli/lcwlabeled-cats-in-the-wild?rvi=1">LCW(Labeled Cats In The Wild) by DSEIDLI </a>. 
                                It was hard to just get a cat data set as opposed to a cat vs dog data set, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/animal-breed-cats-and-dogs?rvi=1">Animal Breed - Cats and Dogs by SPARSH GUPTA</a>.  </p>

                            <p>Much of the data was the same, it resulted in the dots to overlap:</p>
                            <div><img src="static/finalcatphotos/scatterdotoverlap.png"></div>
                            <p>We only saw 28 dots on the scatter plot when there should be 61. 
                                So to check if our code was drawing all the dots we revisited the spread sheet with our data and there was 
                                a bunch of overlap between the various cat breeds. </p>
                                <div><img class="medium-small-img" src="static/finalcatphotos/catdataoverlaprevisit.png"></div>
                                
                                <p>So then we decided to see how much overlap there was by creating a different sheet. 
                                    In this sheet we (i.e. Kazu) grouped all the duplicates together by color. Then we counted the number of color groups we have.

                                    This happened in a couple of steps and with figuring out a couple different pieces.

                                        <h4> 2.1 Figuring out what HTML elements had to do with linking</h4>
                                        <p> One piece to figuring out the linking was to understand how paths work, or so we thought. 
                                            This led us to writing down our plan and goals relating to how we wanted to solve the linking problem.</p>
                                        <div><img src="static/finalcatphotos/pathfunctionwhiteboard.jpeg" style="max-width: 70%;"></div>
                                        <p>We were also brainstorming how path elements could relate to linking the two graphs together since we were not sure 
                                            what path elements had to do with linking in the first place. So as we were trying to link things up we realized that 
                                            we needed to have one country get mapped to one or many cats and also have one cat map to one or many countries. This led us into the next part. </p>
                                </div>
                                <div id="linking-two-onetomany">
                                    <h4> 2.2 Mapping a one to many connection through class and id </h4>
                                    <p>So we went to office hours to ask more about how to link up a one to many relationship and our professor suggested we try to set the class of 
                                        a circle element to all the countries the cat was from and to set the id of the paths to the country name. <br>
                                        This led us to think about how class and ids relate to linking the two graphs together. So we went back to the white board 
                                        thinking about how to link the different elements together so that when you highlight (ie. mouse over) one element in one SVG, it changes the attributes of another element in the other SVG.

                                    <p> It was around here that we realized a variety of things: </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>How the js Map object was going to allow us to get access to rows of the table we were interested in.</li>
                                        <li>How the different elements were encapsulated and modifying path elements did not affect circle elements. Also we need to keep track of which pieces belonged to which SVG.</li>
                                        <div><img class="medium-img" src="static/finalcatphotos/pathfunctionnotebook.jpeg"></div>
                                        <li>How selection allowed us to change HTML elements dynamically
                                        </li>
                                        <li>That the path element was no different from other elements and thus we can modify it in the same way we are modifying the circle elements for the scatter plot. </li>
                                        <li>How we can join data to an HTML and how to acess that data.
                                        </li>
                                        
                                        <li>How to get access to the data stored into HTML by using JS maps. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>That we need to create a separate CSV and Map for countries and the cat breeds that are associated with that country.</li>

                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Funny thing about all these relizations was their connection to our understanding of the roles of classes and ids for HTML and Js.</p>

                                                Seeing how this worked for the circles and cat breeds we then thought ok so we just need to do this for the path objects. However, our Map only took cat breeds as the key. We also needed to use one country to find one to many cats.

                                                To do this, we had to go back to Google Colab and create a separate CSV that had countries, the number of cats breeds from those countries, and a list of cat breed names. Using this new CSV, we made another map object that had countries as keys and a list of breeds from each country as values.

                                        So around a week after working on our project, the professor had us demo and evaluate the current state of our projects so that we could improve and iterate on them.
                                        This is an important step of the design process because it allows us to challenge our assumptions and consider areas where we are 
                                        not as doing as well as we think we are. It allows us to incorporate others perspectives while at the same time learn about those perspectives.

                                            He had us list out three good points that worked well, two bad points that made the task difficult, and at least one suggestion for improvements on each other's visualizations. </p>

                                                The feedback about finding info about specific breeds in the scatter plot is helpful since it directly interferes with the tasks

                                                The same goes for the difficulties around the tooltip for countries with long cat lists and not having the tooltip for 
                                                the scatter plot dots having name and country

                                                but it would also take up more space when it pops up and potentially block out access and visibility to other dots

                                                We do not want to modify the data values too much to preserve it.  </li>
