                    <p> Hello, some data visualizations have strict purposes. I am just ccoding up some visualizations just for my own personal enjoyment.
                    And what something else I enjoy? Reading manga. So I decided to look at some data regarding the best selling manga as of 2023.</p>
                </div>
<!-- <p>
Questions: 
1. A description of your problem domain. Include any information you think your peers will need to understand the context of your data and tasks.
2. Introduce your dataset! What information is available to you? Are there any limitations or issues?
3. Describe your tasks/questions relating to the data, and prime the reader to start looking at your viz
4. Embed your visualizations, making sure there is sufficient labeling and description for the reader to understand them
5. Conclude with any interesting trends you found, things that were interesting, or even mention any non-results you had!

                    <p> <b>Serialization</b> - For a manga to be serialized it means the series is now getting support from a publisher. 
                        Manga are usually serialized in these manga magazines.

                    <h3> Data Set: Best Selling Manga - D RAHULSINGH</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/best-selling-manga">Best Selling Manga</a>
                    <p> I found this data set on Kaggle and its basically the most popular manga based on its cumulative Sales for its
                        Manga series. For this data set, these are the attributes:</p>
                   <ul> 
                    <li>Manga series</li>
                    <li>Author(s)</li>	
                    <li>Publisher</li>
                    <li>Demographic	</li>
                    <li>No. of collected volumes</li>	
                    <li>Serialization</li>		
                    <li>Approximate sales in million(s)	</li>
                    <li>Average sales per volume in million(s) </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><b> Modification:</b> For this manga the serialization given was a range. So we added two extra colums for the serialization start date and its end date. For the manga on hiatus or on going we put the end date as 2023.</p>
                   <p> <b>Limitation:</b> For this dataset, we do not have the sales for each year, we have only one point of reference. The last update for this data set occured in 2023. So this is a snapshot of the manga sales in 2023. This limitation impacted the data viusalizations since we can not graph the data over time, but rather try to see if there are any patterns amoung the other attributes for one point in time. For more of a sense of progressing and history, the best we can do is to look at the serialization start dates or look at the duration. </p>

                    <p> From data can see that Shonen is a popular Genre. See that a lot of manga was serialized around the 1990s</p>
                    <p>  From the Scatter plot, there are a lot of dots in the bottom left corner. Also, looks like there maybe a cut off price, since no dot goes below a certain number. </p>
                    <p>  Overall would have liked to make more visualizations for instance a visualization invloving the publishers to compare with deomgraphics. I would also like to be able to get better at drawing conclusions from data in addition to getting better at visualizing data. </p>
                    <!-- There were a bunch of things we thought of that we could do with the data.
                    See what publisher has the most sales
                    See the most common publisher
                    See which genre is the most common
                    See which manga had the most sales

                    

                    In the end we ended up just doing, 
                    See what manga has the most sales 
                    See which genre is the most common
                    See the most common publisher
                    See the sales for manga over its life time 
                    
                    It seemed that we were just interested in analyzing the demographics and the start date for the manga.
